Pazudora EXP Calculator
===================
Original idea was from www.puzzledragonx.com/. I decided to redesign that particular section/tool of their monster page and to try to make it a faster/better experience.

This is a [Puzzle & Dragons](http://www.gunghoonline.com/games/puzzle-dragons/) tool to calculate the remaining EXP needed to max out a monster. Much simpler to use and faster to use because it's done in Javascript/Jquery.

Thank you [PADHerder](https://www.padherder.com/) for providing their API with a neatly packed JSON file to make this tool possible with the data. All the data are from other sources credited in their credits, I simply made the UI/UX since Puzzle Dragon X Database has been slow and chunky for me.

Future Features:
----
- Clicking on Evo would take you to that monster's info.
- May include Evo chain on monster info page.
- Most recent searches / most popular searches (requires back-end integration)
- Local storage to store previously entered exp for searched monsters (?)
- UI theme changer (allows for user to change the skin of the UI)
